/*
  I've been reading up on BEM naming convention and find that it fits with my idea of organization.
  
  http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/css-architecture-for-design-systems/ has been an inspiration and help for naming

  `.dl` is the namespace. This might change to `.mdl-`
  `c-` is for component classes.
  `h-` is for helper classes
  `u-` is for utilities
  `l-` is for layout

  For a button it will read like `.dlc-button`, while a margin helper class will read like 
  `.dlh-margin__right--8` this is a margin-right class that addes 8px to the right;
